	abstract = {Flow visualization and characterization of multiphase flows have been the quest of many fluid mechanicians. The process is fairly straight forward only when there is good optical access (i.e., the vessel is not opaque or there are appropriate viewing ports) and the flow is transparent, implying a very low volume fraction of the dispersed phase; however, when optical access is not good or the fluid is opaque, alternative methods must be developed. Several different noninvasive visualization tools have been developed to provide high-quality qualitative and quantitative data of various multiphase flow characteristics, and overviews of these methods have appeared in the literature. X-ray imaging is one family of noninvasive measurement techniques used extensively for product testing and evaluation of static objects with complex structures. X-rays can also be used to visualize and characterize multiphase flows. This paper provides a review of the current status of X-ray flow visualization and details various X-ray flow visualization methods that can provide qualitative and quantitative information about the characteristics of complex multiphase flows.},

In this article we review the achievements of PIV and its latest implementations: time-resolved PIV for the rapid capture of sequences of vector fields; tomographic PIV for the capture of fully resolved volumetric data; and statistical PIV, designed to optimize measurements of mean statistical quantities rather than instantaneous fields. In each implementation, the accuracy and spatial resolution are limited. To advance the method to the next level, we need a completely new approach. We consider the fundamental limitations of two-pulse PIV in terms of its dynamic ranges. We then discuss new paths and developments that hold the promise of achieving a fundamental reduction in uncertainty. }

A short history is first given of the major milestones in the development of the stochastic particle method for calculating liquid fuel sprays. The most recent advance has been the discovery of the importance of drop breakup in engine sprays. We present a new method, called the TAB method, for calculating drop breakup. Some theoretical properties of the method are derived; its numerical implementation in the computer program KIVA is described; and comparisons are presented between TAB-method calculations and experiments and calculations using another breakup model.",
